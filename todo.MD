## Authentication:
1. Transition to use the slack python framework
2. Incorporate OAuth permissions instead of inputting from the bot api 
 
## Messages:
1. Build logging method to only track the greet messages (logging.greet)
2. Better template that incorporates whatever #oc-projects would like
3. Name of bot/ username?
4. Do we want to user `real_name` or `user_id`

## Running Bot:
1. Currently only running locally, discussion on how to continually run it where hosted.

## Unit Tests:
1. I really want to add some unit tests, for this some of the things were really frustrating to deal with and I'd like to make sure I have the right functionality.
